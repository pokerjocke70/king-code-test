# Code test for King

## Nonfunctional requirements

- This server will be handling a lot of simultaneous requests, so make good use of the available
memory and CPU, while not compromising readability or integrity of the data.
- Do not use any external frameworks, except for testing. For HTTP, use
com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer.
- There is no need for persistence to disk, the application shall be able to run for any foreseeable
future without crashing anyway.
- 
## Functional requirements

The functions are described in detail below and the notation <value> means a call parameter value or
a return value. All calls shall result in the HTTP status code 200, unless when something goes wrong,
where anything but 200 must be returned. Numbers parameters and return values are sent in
decimal ASCII representation as expected (ie no binary format).
Users and levels are created “ad-hoc”, the first time they are referenced.

### Login

This function returns a session key in the form of a string (without spaces or “strange” characters)
which shall be valid for use with the other functions for 10 minutes. The session keys should be
“reasonably unique”.

```
Request: GET /<userid>/login
Response: <sessionkey>
<userid> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
<sessionkey> : A string representing session (valid for 10 minutes).
Example: http://localhost:8081/4711/login --> UICSNDK
```

### Post a user's score to a level

This method can be called several times per user and level and does not return anything. Only
requests with valid session keys shall be processed.

```
Request: POST /<levelid>/score?sessionkey=<sessionkey>
Request body: <score>
Response: (nothing)
<levelid> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
<sessionkey> : A session key string retrieved from the login function.
<score> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
Example: POST http://localhost:8081/2/score?sessionkey=UICSNDK (with the
post body: 1500)
```

### Get a high score list for a level

Retrieves the high scores for a specific level. The result is a comma separated list in descending score
order. Because of memory reasons no more than 15 scores are to be returned for each level. Only
the highest score counts. ie: an user id can only appear at most once in the list. If a user hasn't
submitted a score for the level, no score is present for that user. A request for a high score list of a
level without any scores submitted shall be an empty string.

```
Request: GET /<levelid>/highscorelist
Response: CSV of <userid>=<score>
<levelid> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
<score> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
<userid> : 31 bit unsigned integer number
Example: http://localhost:8081/2/highscorelist - > 4711=1500
```

### Known limitations / TODO

- Naive exception handling
- Better parsers for path param and request params
